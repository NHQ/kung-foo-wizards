##Intro
MET West, a [Big Picture](http://www.bigpicture.org/) school, encourages students to follow their interests and seek outside opportunities to learn, such as through apprenticeships.  Students may leave campus to attend classes and apprenticeships. This project will provide opportunities for students to learn computer programming __as it applies to their particular interests__.  See (Project Goals)[/campaign/goals.md] for more information.

In addition to apprenticeships, the project seeks to provide a base level of digital/web literacy to all students of MET West, through on-campus classes and presentations.
