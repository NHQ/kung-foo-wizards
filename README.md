##Intro
MET West, a [Big Picture](http://www.bigpicture.org/) school, encourages students to follow their interests and seek outside opportunities to learn, such as through apprenticeships.  Students may leave campus to attend classes and apprenticeships. This project will provide opportunities for students to learn computer programming _as it applies to their particular interests_.  See [Project Goals](/campaign/goals.md) for more information and other goals.
